# ðŸš€ Migration Copilot MVP - Cursor Quick Start

## What You're Building

A web app that transforms WooCommerce/Custom CSVs to Shopify format with AI-powered field mapping and smart attribute handling.

**Time to MVP: 1-2 weeks**
**Time to first pilot: 2-3 weeks**

---

## Step 1: Download Cursor

1. Go to https://cursor.com
2. Download for Mac/Windows/Linux
3. Install (it's like VS Code but with superpowers)

---

## Step 2: Create Your Project

```bash
# Create new project folder
mkdir migration-copilot-mvp
cd migration-copilot-mvp

# Create folder structure
mkdir -p backend/app/services backend/app/routes
mkdir -p frontend/src/components frontend/src/api
```

---

## Step 3: Copy Starter Code

I've created all the starter code for you in:
- `MVP_PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - See the full architecture
- `CURSOR_STARTER_CODE.md` - Copy all the code from here

**Just copy-paste each file** into your new project structure.

---

## Step 4: Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GEMINI_API_KEY
```

---

## Step 5: Setup Frontend

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Done!
```

---

## Step 6: Run It

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python -m app.main
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser!

## Step 7: Use Cursor AI to Build Features

Now the magic happens! Open your project in Cursor and use AI to build features fast.

### Cursor Keyboard Shortcuts:

**Cmd/Ctrl + K** - Edit code inline with AI
```
Example: Highlight a function and press Cmd+K, then type:
"Add error handling and logging to this function"
```

**Cmd/Ctrl + L** - Chat with AI about your code
```
Example: Press Cmd+L and ask:
"How do I add pagination to the product list?"
```

**Cmd/Ctrl + I** - Composer (AI writes code for you)
```
Example: Press Cmd+I and type:
"Create a function that detects duplicate product handles"
```

### Example Cursor Prompts:

**For backend:**
- "Implement the full product transformation logic in transformer.py based on the n8n workflow"
- "Add SQLite database support with SQLAlchemy models"
- "Create API endpoint for saving transformation sessions"
- "Add unit tests for the transformer service"

**For frontend:**
- "Improve the upload UI with drag-and-drop and progress bar"
- "Create a better override selector with checkboxes instead of multi-select"
- "Add loading states and error messages"
- "Make the UI responsive for mobile"

**For features:**
- "Add export history so users can re-download previous transformations"
- "Implement bulk editing for overrides"
- "Add a preview of the transformed CSV before download"
- "Create admin dashboard to track usage"

---

## Step 8: Port Your n8n Logic

You already have working transformation logic in your n8n workflow!

**Copy from n8n â†’ Cursor:**

1. **Open your Transform & QA node code** from n8n
2. **In Cursor, press Cmd/Ctrl + L** and say:
   "I have JavaScript code from n8n that transforms WooCommerce to Shopify. Help me convert it to Python for the ProductTransformer class"
3. **Paste the n8n code**
4. **Cursor will convert it to Python for you!**

Same for:
- AI mapping logic â†’ `ai_mapper.py`
- Attribute analysis â†’ `transformer.py`
- Override handling â†’ `override_handler.py`

---

## Step 9: Deploy for Pilot

When you're ready to test with your first agency:

### Option 1: Railway (Easiest)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Deploy backend
cd backend
railway up

# Deploy frontend
cd ../frontend
railway up
```

### Option 2: Render
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to render.com
3. Connect your repo
4. Deploy backend as "Web Service"
5. Deploy frontend as "Static Site"

### Option 3: Vercel + Railway
- Frontend â†’ Vercel (best for React)
- Backend â†’ Railway (best for Python)

---

## Development Workflow

### Daily workflow:
1. **Open Cursor**
2. **Pick a feature** from your roadmap
3. **Ask Cursor AI to implement it** (Cmd/Ctrl + L)
4. **Test it** in your browser
5. **Iterate** based on feedback
6. **Commit to git** when working

### When stuck:
1. **Cmd/Ctrl + L**: "I'm getting this error: [paste error]. How do I fix it?"
2. **Cursor will debug and fix it for you**

### Building features fast:
1. **Cmd/Ctrl + I**: "Add [feature description]"
2. **Cursor generates the code**
3. **Review and accept**
4. **Test**
5. **Done!**

## Why This Will Be Faster Than n8n

**n8n workflow debugging:**
- Hard to debug (limited logging)
- Complex connections
- Race conditions
- No version control

**Cursor development:**
- Full control over code
- AI helps you debug instantly
- Proper error messages
- Git version control
- Easy to test locally
- Fast iteration

---

## What Cursor Does That's Magic

1. **Understands your entire codebase** - It knows how all your files connect
2. **Writes code for you** - Describe what you want, it builds it
3. **Debugs instantly** - Paste an error, get a fix
4. **Refactors** - "Make this code more efficient" â†’ done
5. **Explains** - "What does this function do?" â†’ clear explanation
6. **Tests** - "Write unit tests for this" â†’ tests generated

It's like having a senior developer pair programming with you 24/7.

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Download Cursor
2. âœ… Create project folder
3. âœ… Copy starter code
4. âœ… Run backend & frontend
5. âœ… Open in Cursor
6. ðŸš€ **Use Cursor AI to build your MVP!**

**First Cursor prompt to try:**
```
Cmd/Ctrl + L: "I want to implement the product transformation logic.
I have n8n JavaScript code that does this. Can you help me convert
it to Python and add it to the ProductTransformer class?"
```

Then paste your n8n Transform & QA node code, and watch Cursor convert it!

## Questions?

If you hit any roadblocks, just ask Cursor! Press Cmd/Ctrl + L and describe your problem. It's like having Stack Overflow + a senior dev + documentation all in one.

**Good luck building your MVP! ðŸš€**
